This program is a test to showcase saving arbitrary strings (limited to 1024 characters) into an arena of memory.

No classes are used, this program was designed to test my ability to handle custom string (character array) reading and writing within custom memory arenas.

Full debug information is provided to step through with a debugger to see the strings be written directly into memory.



IMPORTANT!!!

- To compile, I used Visual Studio 2022 Developer Command Prompt v17.14.0 on x64 architecture to compile on the command line.

- Once you're ready to compile, make sure to navigate to the directory containing the source code, then just run build_here.bat by using the developer command prompt.
